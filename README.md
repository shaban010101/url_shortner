##Notes
I was debating on whether or not to validate the URL and I opted not to for this version of the application as it wasn't as straightforward and I wanted spend the rest of my time working on the other parts of the application. I wasn't able to add automatically reloading the list of URLs when a new one is added but this can be added in a future version of the app
